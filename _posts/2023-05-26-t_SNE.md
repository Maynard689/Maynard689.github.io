## t-SNE

Here is another rhyme, this time about t-SNE in deep learning:

*In the realm of deep learning's might,
Where images hold secrets, hidden from sight,
We seek a tool, both clever and wise,
To unravel the patterns that lie in disguise.*

*Enter t-SNE, a hero so grand,
With powers to transform, like magic in hand,
It reduces dimensions, with grace so fine,
Unleashing insights, like a radiant sign.*

*In image deep learning, it plays a crucial role,
Unveiling clusters, their stories untold,
It maps high-dimensional spaces with care,
Revealing connections, so vivid and rare.*

*From pixels and features, it weaves a tale,
Uncovering relationships, never to fail,
Visualizing embeddings, in colors so bright,
Guiding us closer, to truth's pure light.*

*With t-SNE's guidance, we traverse the abyss,
Unlocking knowledge, with each gentle twist,
From classification to object detection,
It aids our quest, with profound introspection.*

*So let us celebrate, this tool so divine,
For t-SNE's magic, in image deep learning shines,
It helps us see what was once concealed,
Unveiling the mysteries, our visions revealed.*
