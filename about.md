# About Me

In the realm of knowledge's domain,
There walks a student, Maynard by name,
With engineering prowess, he sets his stride,
A final UQ chapter, where dreams collide.

Through the corridors of intellect he roams,
Seeking truths hidden, unraveling unknowns,
The world of equations, his playground of thought,
Maynard, the seeker, with wisdom sought.

In the realm of equations and machines,
He conquers challenges, like a scholar supreme,
From circuits to structures, he treads the path,
Ingenious ideas spring from his insightful math.

But amidst the equations and complex designs,
A love for flavors, a passion that entwines,
For deep-fried indulgence, he holds no shame,
Maynard's heart beats for the love of KFC's flame.

The crispy chicken, succulent and divine,
The aroma lures him like a captivating rhyme,
He savors each bite, a momentary retreat,
From textbooks and formulas, a tasty feat.

With diligence, he toils, day and night,
For success and triumph, his ultimate delight,
Yet in the realm of dreams, he finds a pause,
To savor KFC's magic, a heavenly cause.

Maynard, the visionary, engineering's knight,
Balancing logic and flavor with sheer delight,
As you tread the final steps, ambitious and grand,
Know that your love for KFC makes you truly expand.

So, onward, Maynard, with dreams set high,
Engineering's finale gleams in your eye,
Embrace the knowledge, let flavors inspire,
A tale of success, with KFC as your fire.
